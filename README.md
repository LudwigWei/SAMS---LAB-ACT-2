The Student Attendance Management System is a web-based platform designed to automate attendance tracking in educational institutions. It replaces traditional manual methods with QR code-based or RFID-based scanning to ensure real-time monitoring, accuracy, and security. This system minimizes errors, enhances efficiency, and provides instant access to attendance records for instructors, and administrators.
